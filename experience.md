Listed below are the main professional experiences I am lucky to have been a part of during my first year of college. If you'd like to learn more about my professional experiences in High School, please check out the [Education](https://ronithgan.github.io/education/) page.

### Front-End Developer at M-Lead (May 2022 - Present)

M-Lead is the primary leadership center for the University of Michigan and is responsible for amplifying leadership skills to undergraduate and graduate students. I am responsible for advancing the development of the M-Lead site by editing and adding content to the site to make it faster and simpler for students at U-M. I've asssessed the website performance for M-Lead to determine which pages are performing better and enhance the UI of those pages to increase visibility within the campus. I also introduced new features to the site to make it easier for students to access leadership opportunities so that they can grow throughout their time at the University of Michigan.

### Business Analyst at APEX Consulting (January 2022 - Present)

APEX Consulting is the premier consulting organization at the University of Michigan. As a part of the organization, I work with both local and nationwide businesses to help them succeed in the real world. I recently worked with a sustainable vehicle startup based in California and helped devise a 50-page business plan for them. I created a geographic launch plan that accounted for a multitude of factors and wrote an algorithm to determine what are the most suitable states in the US for the company to distribute vehicles at. I also identified various corporate partnerships for the company and created a 10-year financial projection plan based on a comparables analysis that I conducted. My work for this client immediately translated into meaningful results. After our team finished writing the business plan for our client, they presented the plan in front of investors and raised $40 million of funding.


### Co-Founder of Bingo (June 2020 - July 2021)

After participating in the [LaunchX](https://launchx.com/) program, I worked on creating a startup that aims to improve accessibility for senior citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic. With elderly citizens being more affected by COVID-19 while also struggling more with digital technology, I wanted to find a way to make it easier for them to adapt during this difficult period, focusing specifically on adapting to e-commerce websites. After conducting one-on-one interviews and developing user surveys to identify this problem, I created a Google Chrome extension that adds graphics and audio features on e-commerce sites to improve both visual and auditory accessibility. I programmed the extension using primarily JavaScript and also integrated Amazon Polly to implement text-to-speech capabilities. The extension was live on the Chrome Web Store as I developed it throughout the first half of 2021 and marketed the product to elderly citizens. More information about how I coded the project can be found [here](https://ronithgan.github.io/projects/)
