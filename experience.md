Listed below are the main professional experiences I am lucky to have been a part of during my first year of college:

### Front-End Developer at M-Lead (May 2022 - Present)
M-Lead is the primary leadership center for the University of Michigan and is responsible for amplifying leadership skills to undergraduate and graduate students. I am responsible for advancing the development of the M-Lead site by editing and adding content to the site to make it faster and simpler for students at U-M. I've asssessed the website performance for M-Lead to determine which pages are performing better and enhance the UI of those pages to increase visibility within the campus. I also introduced new features to the site to make it easier for students to access leadership opportunities so that they can grow throughout their time at the University of Michigan.

Here is a link to the [M-Lead site](https://mlead.umich.edu/) where you can see some of the work I've been doing!

### Business Analyst at APEX Consulting (January 2022 - Present)



### Co-Founder of Bingo (June 2020 - July 2021)



These are just a few of the experiences I've been grateful to have been a part of over my first year of college. If you'd like to learn more about my professional experiences in High School, please check out the [Education](https://ronithgan.github.io/education/) page.
