Listed below are the main professional experiences I am lucky to have been a part of during my first year of college. If you'd like to learn more about my professional experiences in High School, please check out the [Education](https://ronithgan.github.io/education/) page.

### üîê Engineering Product Manager Intern at Cisco (May 2023 - August 2023)

I have been interning with Cisco since May 2023 for the Cloud & Network Security team within the Cisco Security Business Group. More details to come once my internship is complete!

### üî¨ Research Assistant at U-M School of Information (November 2022 - Present)


### üìä Project Manager at APEX Consulting (January 2022 - Present)

[APEX Consulting](http://www.apexconsulting.org/) is the premier consulting organization at the University of Michigan. As a part of the organization, I work with local and nationwide businesses to help them succeed in the real world. My first client was a sustainable vehicle startup based in California and helped devise a 50-page business plan for them. I created a geographic launch plan that accounted for a multitude of regional factors and wrote an algorithm that determined what are the most suitable states in the US for the company to distribute vehicles. Additionally, I identified various corporate partnerships for the company and created a 10-year financial projection plan based on a comparables analysis. My work for this client immediately translated into meaningful results -- after our team finished writing the business plan for our client, the company presented the plan in front of investors and raised $40 million of funding. I've also worked with a cybersecurity startup to conduct an ideal customer analysis to enhance their customer acquisition efforts, generating pitches to attract 30+ ideal businesses. For my most recent client, a wearable fitness company endorsed by multiple professional athletes, I created a marketing plan with 7 primary recommendations to help them boost their social media presence and attract college students.


### üíª Web Developer at M-Lead (May 2022 - Present)

M-Lead is the primary leadership center for the University of Michigan and is responsible for amplifying leadership skills for both undergraduate and graduate students. I am responsible for advancing the development of the M-Lead website by editing and adding content to the site to make it faster and simpler for students at U-M. I've assessed the website performance for M-Lead to determine which pages are performing better and enhanced the UI of those pages to increase visibility within the campus, increasing website traffic by 35%. I also introduced multiple new features to the site to make it easier for students to access leadership opportunities so that they can find personalized resources based on their interests and grow into independent leaders throughout their time at the University of Michigan.
