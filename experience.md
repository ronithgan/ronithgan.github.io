Listed below are the main professional experiences I am lucky to have been a part of during my first two years of college. 

## üîê Engineering Product Manager Intern at Cisco (May 2023 - August 2023)

I have been working at Cisco since May 2023 for the Cloud & Network Security team within the Cisco Security Business Group. More details to come once my internship is complete!


## üî¨ Research Assistant at U-M School of Information (November 2022 - Present)

For the past few months, I have been working with Professors [Paramveer Dhillon](https://pdhillon.com/) and Elle O'Brien to integrate learning models with modern web information systems. Specifically, I am currently working on publishing a scholarly paper based on health and wellness information with social network analysis, currently pending submission to JAMIA. I've trained a word embedding model to parse through 80 billion Twitter posts, characterizing beliefs about health across social media and identifying the top influencers related to misinformation through a retweet network. This research will help us understand how influencers responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and how these arguments are framed to their audience. This experience has helped me learn more about data science through Spark and Python to examine the societal impact of information systems today.


## üìä Project Manager at APEX Consulting (January 2022 - Present)

[APEX Consulting](http://www.apexconsulting.org/) is the premier consulting organization at the University of Michigan. As a part of the organization, I work with local and national businesses to help them succeed in the real world. 

#### Project 1: Aptera Motors ####
My first client was a sustainable vehicle startup based in California and I helped devise a 50-page business plan for them. I created a geographic launch plan that accounted for a multitude of regional factors and wrote an algorithm that determined the most suitable states in the US for the company to distribute vehicles. Additionally, I identified various corporate partnerships for the company and created a 10-year financial projection plan based on a comparables analysis. My work for this client immediately translated into meaningful results -- after our team finished writing the business plan for our client, the company presented our plan in front of investors and raised $40 million of funding. 

#### Project 2: Cybersecurity Startup based in Ann Arbor, MI ####
As a Business Analyst Lead, I worked with a cybersecurity startup to conduct an ideal customer analysis to enhance their customer acquisition efforts, generating pitches to attract 30+ ideal businesses. Learning more about the cybersecurity space, I helped the client leverage their SIEM security solution to improve the cloud-based detection and response security systems of financial and healthcare enterprises across the United States. Throughout the project, I mentored a team of business analysts, meeting with them weekly and holding regular office hours to strengthen their communication and report-writing skills, aiding them in both professional and personal development.

#### Project 3: Wearable Technology Company ####
My most recent client was a wearable technology company endorsed by multiple professional athletes and evaluated at $3 billion+. Our team created a marketing plan with seven primary recommendations to help them boost their social media presence and attract college students. Our recommendations were guided by evaluating the market through a TAM/SAM/SOM analysis, conducting a campus-wide survey, holding interviews with students in our ideal customer market, and creating sample promotional material for the client to use. As a project manager, I was responsible for communicating between my team and the client, and structuring our project in a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive manner so that we could complete our deliverables on time.

## üíª Web Developer at M-Lead (May 2022 - Present)

M-Lead is the primary leadership center for the University of Michigan and is responsible for amplifying leadership skills for both undergraduate and graduate students. I am responsible for advancing the development of the M-Lead website by editing and adding content to the site to make it faster and simpler for students at U-M. I've assessed the website performance for M-Lead to determine which pages are performing better and enhanced the UI of those pages to increase visibility within the campus, increasing website traffic by 35%. I also introduced multiple new features to the site to make it easier for students to access leadership opportunities so that they can find personalized resources based on their interests and grow into independent leaders throughout their time at the University of Michigan.

Here is a link to the [M-Lead site](https://mlead.umich.edu/) where you can see some of the work I've been doing!
