## My Interests

### Martial Arts ‚ö´

Probably one of the biggest accomplishments of my life so far has been receiving a second-degree black belt. I've been training in martial arts for over 11 years, focusing specifically on tae kwon do and self-defense. Training for my black belts was incredibly rigorous: I did physical training for 8-9 hours a week, 6 days a week, for half a year and once my training was complete, took a 3-day long test. However, the experience was incredibly rewarding and helped me learn about the importance of responsibility and dedication.

I also wanted to pass my experiences to the younger generation of students, which is why I began teaching beginner classes to younger students and mentoring older students training for their black-belts. I taught basic self-defense techniques and kicks, life-skills, and meditation exercises to 15-20 elementary-school level students weekly, inspiring them to work harder and continue learning karate. I became better at communication and speaking to larger audiences as I was teaching skills I'd known my whole life to younger children for the first time. I was even awarded with the Bu Cho Gyo Nim instructor title when I was 16 years old for being a dedicated and respected instructor at my studio.

Here are some pictures of me when I was training for my black belt:


### Volunteering üòÑ

As mentioned in my [High School activities](https://ronithgan.github.io/education/), section I have been heavily involved in volunteering and community service efforts throughout my life. A couple years ago, I was really interested in the medical field so I started volunteering at my local hospital (the same one I was born at!) Once I realized that being a doctor just wasn't who I wanted to be, I decided to keep volunteering because I enjoyed the fact that my work was directly benefiting my community. I greeted patients as they entered the hospital, attended to them by providing food and drinks, and ensuring that the hospital had adequate supplies of PPE in each building. I was later promoted to shift leader where I assigned tasks and responsibilities to other volunteers and supplemented nurse and doctor duties to ensure the entire volunteer department was smoothly running. I gained crucial experience in a fast-paced professional setting while also becoming better at effective communication and collaboration.
