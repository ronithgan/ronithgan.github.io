##### *In this section, I'll be giving a quick overview of a couple of projects that I've worked on over the past few years

I've been interested in computer science for most of my life. What started off as simple Scratch projects became more advanced games and websites as I've learned more about the applications of CS. 

These are the programming languages which I am **proficient** in: C/C++, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
and these are the languages which I am **familiar** with but not completely proficient in: R, ReactJS 

Listen below are some of my favorite projects that I've worked on:

### Bingo: Improving Accessibility on E-Commerce Websites (JavaScript)

### Stock Market Simulator (C++)

### Image Resize (C++)

### Productivity Planner (ReactJS)

### Sudoku Solver (Python)

### Plagiarism Checker (Java)

### Comparing the Effects of Education Spending with Income Inequality (R)

### Understanding Prisoner's Dilemma (R)
