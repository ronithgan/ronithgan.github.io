##### *In this section, I'll be giving a quick overview of a couple of projects that I've worked on over the past few years*

I've been interested in computer science for most of my life. What started off as simple Scratch projects became more advanced games and websites as I've learned more about the applications of CS. 

These are the programming languages which I am **proficient** in: C/C++, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

and these are the languages which I am **familiar** with but not completely proficient in: 
R, ReactJS
