##### *In this section, I'll be giving a quick overview of a couple of projects that I've worked on over the past few years* 

I've been interested in computer science for most of my life. What started off as simple Scratch projects became more advanced games and websites as I've learned more about the applications of CS. 

These are the programming languages which I am **proficient** in: C/C++, Python, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

and these are the languages which I am **familiar** with but not completely proficient in: 
R, ReactJS 

Listen below are some of my favorite projects that I've worked on. Click on any of the links listed below to directly jump down to the project or scroll down to explore all my projects:

### Research: Comparing the Effects of Education Spending with Income Inequality *(R)* <a name="econometrics"></a>

For my econometrics class in senior year, I decided to study whether or not increasing education spending and having higher school enrollment rates can combat the problem of rising income inequality. I predicted that this would be the case and countries that invest more in education will have lower levels of income inequality.

My predictor variables for the experiment were used to measure education level per country so I chose: government expenditures on education as a % of GDP and the average net enrollment rates for primary school students. For my response variable, I had to measure income inequality and so I used the Gini index: a coefficient that measures the level of wealth inequality within a country from 0 to 100. I also used GDP as an instrumental variable because it has a strong correlation with education expenditures. GDP can be used to measure the economic conditions in a country over time and will usually affect education expenditures because if a country is experiencing a recession and their GDP falls, they will likely allocate less money towards education and more towards other priorities like economic relief. 

I also tested for various robustness tests to look for homoscedasticity, normal residuals, no autocorrelation, linearity, zero conditional mean, and the Wu-Hausman test. The robustness tests and p-value revealed that the model passed all of our assumptions.

As a result of this model, I discovered that my hypothesis was correct and conclude that there is a significant correlation between the education expenditures and income inequality. From this analysis, we can conclude that the % of GDP that a country spends on education is an important factor in reducing income inequality as countries that spent more on education had a lower Gini index which means there is more income equality. This means that in order to curb inequality, countries should focus on spending a greater amount on education funding.

Here's the data from the experiment:
